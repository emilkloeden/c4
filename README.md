# c4

A stylised implementation of Connect 4 built using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS and websockets.

Offers two modes: multiplayer online at `/` and offline at `/one-device`

## Installation and usage

`git clone ...`
`npm run start`

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to play 'online' (you'll be automatically assigned to a 'room' as either player 1 or 2, the game starts when two players are assigned to the same room) or `http://localhost:3000/one-device` to play 'offline' (two players alternate turns on the one device).
